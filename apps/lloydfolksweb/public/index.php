			<h1>Hello and welcome to LloydFolks.com!</h1>
			<hr>
			<h2>Why so...<i>basic</i>?</h2>
			<p>I am still in the process of designing and coding the site as time permits between my current job and my pursuit in finding a new job. While this process is slower than I would prefer, it does award me the opportunity to take time to truly think about the design and how I want to structure my code.</p>
			<p>Please feel free to check back anytime and see what changes!</p>
			<h2>Current Plans</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Get the landing page coded and uploaded to the web server!
					<ol>
						<li>IN PROGRESS</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					Create the contact page so that people can reach out to me easily!
				</li>
				<li>
					Create the resume page so that my skills and experience can be shared with the world!
				</li>
				<li>
					Create the about me page so that I can share more details about...well...me!
				</li>
				<li>
					Create the portfolio page so that I link my various projects to be reviewed by anyone interested!
				</li>
				<li>
					Outline plans for recreating this site using various frameworks and technology such as AngularJS, Vue.js, Laravel, and others!
				</li>
